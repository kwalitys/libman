# Library Management System

## Instructions To Use:

- This is made completely using Java.
- For this to be working in your machine, please change the file name which is mentioned in line 18 of Catalogue.java to your preferred file.
- This system involves the use of file reading and writing and it does it on the same file.
- The program is just purely the backend and hence does not possess any front end.
- To operate it please run Library.java of the libman file using your preferred IDE.
- Before doing so, please make a file and provide its full directory length at line 18 of Catalogue.java.

## The Functionalities :

- This can create, read, update and delete books, CDs, DVDs and Magazines.
- This can search through the entire catalogue against name, time of publishing, author, duration and number of pages.
- Uses the file system as the database.

This project may include errors, as it was pretty much just tested by me.
